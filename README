NAME
    HTTP::Response::Encoding - Adds encoding() to HTTP::Response

VERSION
    $Id: README,v 0.2 2007/05/12 09:24:15 dankogai Exp $

SYNOPSIS
      use LWP::UserAgent;
      use HTTP::Response::Encoding;

      my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
      my $res = $ua->get("http://www.example.com/");
      warn $res->encoding;

EXPORT
    Nothing.

METHODS
    This module adds the following methods to HTTP::Response objects.

    "$res->charset"
      Tells the charset *exactly as appears* in the "Content-Type:" header.
      Note that the presence of the charset does not guarantee if the
      response content is decodable via Encode.

      To normalize this, you should try

        $res->encoder->mime_name; # with Encode 2.21 or above

      or

        use I18N::Charset;
        # ...
        mime_charset_name($res->encoding);

    "$res->encoder"
      Returns the corresponding encoder object or undef if it can't.

    "$res->encoding"
      Tells the content encoding in the canonical name in Encode. Returns
      undef if it can't.

      For most cases, you are more likely to successfully find encoding
      after GET than HEAD. HTTP::Response is smart enough to parse

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=whatever"/>

      But you need the content to let HTTP::Response parse it. If you don't
      want to retrieve the whole content but interested in its encoding, try
      something like below;

        my $req =  HTTP::Request->new(GET => $uri);
        $req->headers->header(Range => "bytes=0-4095"); # just 1st 4k
        my $res = $ua->request($req);
        warn $res->encoding;

    "$res->decoded_content"
      Discontinued since HTTP::Message already has this method.

      See HTTP::Message for details.
